1.Run compmgmt.msc to open console for Computer Management with various management options like System Tools, Storage and Services.
System tools has the option of Task Scheduling. Click to edit the existing tasks if needed.

2.Created C:\Data\Library_SQL_Project_2017\Library_Data_Consolidation.sql

3.Created the batch file which has the sqlcmd with server connection, database details and input sql filename

4.Created LibraryTaskScheduler.xml
xmlns keyword is important for the Task tag
specify full path to the batch file

5.Use the below commands to create and run the tasks

6.schtasks /Create /S desktop-6ndur2e /ru purvi /TN LibraryTask /XML "C:\Data\Library_SQL_Project_2017\LibraryTaskScheduler.xml"

7.schtasks /Run /S desktop-6ndur2e /i /TN LibraryTask /hresult

Additional Steps to verify:
--------------------------

1) Make sure that the task is set to "configure for Windows Vista or Windows 2008" on the first page of the task properties (under the "general" tab)

2) Make sure that the task is set to "start in" the folder that contains the batch file: open the task properties, click on the "actions" tab, click on the action and then the "edit" button at the bottom.  In the "Edit Action" Window there is a field for "start in (optional)" that you set to the path to the batch file.
I added the start in option from the action tab. Need to see how to add this field in xml file.
 
3) Make sure that the task is running as an account that has explicit "Full access" permissions to all these things:  The .bat file itself,  the folder containing the .bat file, and the target files/folders that are affected by the .bat script.  Inherited permissions didn't seem to work for me.

4) Make sure that the account running the task is a member of the local "administrators" group for this machine
Run cmd prompt as administrator from the windows accessory menu.

5) Make sure that the task is set to "run whether logged on or not"

6) The Task should run successfully with expected output when you right-click on the task and select "run"  If it does that then it will run successfully when you are logged off.
